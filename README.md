# cash
One of the disadvantages of paying in cash is the trouble of having to carry change. While the best option would be to not use cash often, this program is the next best solution!

Carrying lots of coins in your pockets can be heavy and unsanitary, so it is always best to carry as little on you as possible! 

This program will ask user for price of item, and how much they are paying in cash. It will then calculate the change owed and determine the fewest number of coins needed to make that change. Additionally, it will provide a detailed breakdown, showing how many of each type of coin (*) you would receive as part of the change

(*):  types of coins refers to pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents)
