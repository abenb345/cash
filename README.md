# cash
One of the disadvantages of paying in cash is the trouble of having to carry change. Carrying lots of coins in your pockets can be heavy and unsanitary, so it is always best to carry as little on you as possible! 

While the best solution would be to not use cash often, this program is the next best thing!

This program asks user for price of item, and how much you are paying. Then, it will calculate the change owed and break down the least number of coins with which the change can be made. It also breaks it down into more detail to see how many of which types of coins (*) you would get back 

(*):  types of coins refers to pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents)
